# Improved Precision and Recall Metric for Assessing Generative Models 

This project is done as a part of the deep learning interview stage for NAVER Corp. It is mostly based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06991.pdf) with the same name. The paper provides an improved precision and recall metric for General Adversarial Networks(GANs) using a binary function and k-nearest neighbors. The interviewer asked to calculate the precision and recall metric defined in this paper by applying it to two sets of 10000 images from a dataset such as celebA or CIFAR-10, and then explain the precision and recall values alongside in-depth analysis.

## Calculation Process

Within the paper provided, the metrics were calculated by comparing a set of feature vectors from a distribution of real images and a distribution of generated images. The images were generated by using a StyleGAN provided by NVIDIA, and the feature vectors were extracted from a pre-trained VGG-16 classifier.

### calculate.py

The calculate.py file then extracts the feature vector from the image files using the pretrained model of VGG16. It then estimates the manifold using k-NN neighbors and returns the precision and recall value. The function pretrained_model in calculate.py makes use of the VGG16 from Keras (with additional layers : based on [this thread](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/4465), which is used to extract feature vectors of each image. Using the feature vectors extracted from this step, we calculate the precision and recall value following the pseudo-code provided in Appendix A in the aforementioned [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06991.pdf). 

### generate_image.py 

The generate_image.py file generates an image that has been trained by the DCGAN explained above, and returns 10000 generated images. The whole code is based on [this notebook](https://github.com/naokishibuya/deep-learning/blob/master/python/dcgan_celeba.ipynb) with several adjustments, which proposes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network using the same celebA dataset. 

## Results and Analysis

This author wanted to generate 10000 images from a DCGAN and then calculate the precision and recall values of a set of 10000 images from celebA and 10000 images generated by the DCGAN, but the time it took to train a DCGAN using approximately 200000 images from celebA, and then calculating the feature vectors for each 10000 images and estimating its manifolds took more than 8 hours, and thus for practical computational purposes, the author will calculate the precision and recall values of the first 20000 images in the celebA dataset.
