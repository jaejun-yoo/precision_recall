# Improved Precision and Recall Metric for Assessing Generative Models 

This project is done as a part of the deep learning interview stage for NAVER Corp. It is mostly based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06991.pdf) with the same name. The paper provides an improved precision and recall metric for General Adversarial Networks(GANs) using a binary function and k-nearest neighbors. The interviewer asked to calculate the precision and recall metric defined in this paper by applying it to a) a toy dataset, and b) a set of 10000 image sets from datasets such as celebA or CIFAR-10, and then analyze the precision and recall values provided by dataset b).

## Calculation Process

Within the paper provided, the metrics were calculated by comparing a set of feature vectors from a distribution of real images and a distribution of generated images. The images were generated by using a StyleGAN provided by NVIDIA, and the feature vectors were extracted from a pre-trained VGG-16 classifier. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
